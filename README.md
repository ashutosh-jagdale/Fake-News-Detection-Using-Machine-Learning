<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Fake news is one of the most common complaints heard in current generation. As it spreads mis- information in society and minds making them question even real news and facts. So, using a machine learning approach to tackle the problem is the most sensible solution We are performing Feature Engineering in which new features are created on the basis of ML models (Spam detection, Clickbait Analysis, Classification, Sentiment analysis and Stance Detection) and these interns are used in a final ML model. Multiple ML models have been used to compare the result and find out the most accurate among them.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5"><b>AIM</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">To provide users with a reliable platform where they can verify the news if it is fake or real with highest accuracy.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9"><b>OBJECTIVE</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="13">•   To apply Feature Engineering for best result of a fake news.<br>
•   Classify news using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, XG boost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes.<br>
•   To apply Ensemble Learning for best result of a fake news.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15"><b>FEATURES</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="22">•   Spam detection<br>
•   Clickbait analysis<br>
•   Sentiment analysis<br>
•   Classification of news Toxicity<br>
•   Stance Detection<br>
•   Domain Rank</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="29"><b>ADVANTAGES</b><br></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="22">•   Can be offline if user wants it to be.<br>
•   As it uses ML for predictions it can improve itself as more data gets collected.<br>
•   Content Independence.<br>
•   As it is Machine doing classification so it cannot be biased.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="35">•   Various models are built that takes news as an input and outputs its authenticity through accuracy.<br>
•   The obtained accuracy across various models and features for traditional ML methods is been shown.<br>
•   Therefore, providing users with a reliable platform where they can verify the news if it is fake or real with highest accuracy.</p>
